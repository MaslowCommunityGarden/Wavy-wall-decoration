## Materials:

To get all 26 ribs cut, I used **9 wood 100cm x 50cm x 1.8cm panels**. 

To keep them all together, I used **two wood slats 3cm x 3cm x 200cm**.

I fixed all the ribs to the slats with **2.5cm screws**, using the notches I left in the back of each rib.

I used also **6 cylinder led lights** that I embedded downwards in the low wood slat, with a **toggle switch** and a **240V AC to 12V DC transformer**.
